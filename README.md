1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that
    project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you
    will see on the front-end of site (what you see in the browser) such as site
    header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.eslintignore`**: Configuration file for eslint - for files to ignore.

4.  **`.eslintrc.js`**: Configuration file for eslint.

5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not
    maintain a version history for.

6.  **`.prettierignore`**: Configuration file for prettier - for files to
    ignore.

7.  **`.prettierrc`**: Configuration file for prettier.

8.  **`.stylelintignore`**: Configuration file for style lint - for files to
    ignore.

9.  **`.stylelintrc`**: Configuration file for style lint.

10. **`.env.example`**: Example configuration for .env file.

11. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage
    of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/)
    (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings
    affecting the browser.

12. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby
    site. This is where is information about site (metadata) like the site title
    and description, Gatsby plugins, etc. (Check out the
    [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more
    detail).

13. **`lint-staged.config.js`**: Configuration file for lint staged.

14. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an
    automatically generated file based on the exact versions of npm dependencies
    that were installed for project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

15. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes
    things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how
    npm knows which packages to install for project.

16. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about
    project.

17. **`screenshot.png`**: Screenshot of the final website.

18. **`yarn-error.lock`**: The whole point of it is that you read the log to
    find out what went wrong, and if you've not had any errors, it might not
    even exist at all.

19. **`yarn.lock`**: There is an identifier for every dependency and sub
    dependency that is used for a project.
